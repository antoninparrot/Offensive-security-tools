# Xdebug RCE

This python script will make a reverse shell if the server is vulnerable. Xdebug have to be < 2.5.5

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the packages needed.

```bash
pip install socket, requests, time, base64
```

You have to open your port 9000 and make a port redirection to your computer.

## Usage

Change those two lines: 
```python
RHOST = "http://www.target.com/xdebug_path.php"
LHOST = "YOUR_IP"
```
Executing the commandes_php() function will allow you to send php commands. 

Executing the commandes_unix() function will allow you to send bash commands if shell_exec() is enabled on the target.

You might have to modify the decrypt() function if the target returns a special contents.
